I hope that you find these resources useful. They are divided up into different tabs.

### Why use R?

There are a multitude of different pieces of software and different workflows that you can use to create beautiful and intelligible data visualizations.

I think R is a very good choice. There are three reasons I love R for data viz.

1. `ggplot2` is a fantastic library for making data visualizations - it is customizable and logical. 
2. The R community is very supportive and makes learning and improving a pleasure.
3. The entire process of importing and cleaning data, visualizing it, and then sharing it is made easy.
